# My Simple Web Boilerplate

## Notes

I want to try to write ES2015 script in client side, and utilizing React. But I don't want it to be a Single Page Application. Thus, I need to create my own simple boilerplate. The tools that I used in this are Babel, React, and Webpack. It's important to have minimum dependencies, so I tried to create this.
